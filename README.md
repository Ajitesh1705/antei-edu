# üìö AI-Powered EdTech Platform

Welcome to **Antei-Edu**, an innovative AI-powered educational platform designed to enhance learning through modern technology. This project combines a sleek, responsive frontend with powerful AI-driven features, restricted to authenticated users for a secure and personalized experience.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This platform leverages cutting-edge tools to provide an interactive learning environment:
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in via Firebase ensures only authorized users access premium features.
- **AI Chatbot**: An intelligent assistant powered by the OpenRouter API, available exclusively to signed-in users.
- **Modern Design**: Built with Vite, React, ShadCN UI, and TailwindCSS for a fast, visually appealing experience.

Whether you're a student, educator, or developer, this project serves as a foundation for exploring AI in education.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Here‚Äôs the tech stack powering the platform:
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A lightning-fast build tool for modern web development with React.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **[ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: Pre-styled, customizable components for rapid UI development.
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and stylish designs.
- **[React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/)**: Handles client-side routing and navigation.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Provides authentication (email/password, Google, etc.) and a scalable database.
- **[OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/)**: Powers the AI chatbot with natural language processing capabilities.

## üìÇ Project Setup
Follow these steps to get the project running locally on your machine.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v16 or higher recommended) and npm.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** for cloning the repository.
- A **[Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/)** for authentication setup.
- An **[OpenRouter account](https://openrouter.ai/)** to obtain an API key for the chatbot.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ajitesh1705/antei-edu.git
cd antei-edu
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install all required packages:
```sh
npm install
```
> **Tip**: If you encounter errors, try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to resolve peer dependency conflicts.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (`antei-edu/`) to store sensitive configuration:
```sh
touch .env
```

Add the following variables to `.env`:
```
# Firebase Credentials (Get these from Firebase Console > Project Settings)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id

# OpenRouter API Key (Get this from OpenRouter dashboard)
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

#### How to Get These Values:
- **Firebase**: 
  1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
  2. Create a new project or use an existing one.
  3. Navigate to **Project Settings > General** and copy the config object under "Your apps."
- **OpenRouter**: 
  1. Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
  2. Generate an API key from your account dashboard.

> **Note**: Keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to Git (it‚Äôs ignored by `.gitignore` by default).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Development Server
Start the app locally:
```sh
npm run dev
```
- The app will launch at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
- Open this URL in your browser to see the platform in action.

> **Troubleshooting**: If the app doesn‚Äôt load, check the console for errors (e.g., missing env variables) and ensure your Firebase/OpenRouter keys are correct.

## üîê Authentication & Chatbot Restriction
- **User Authentication**: Powered by Firebase Authentication, supporting email/password and Google sign-in.
- **Chatbot Access**: The AI chatbot is a protected feature:
  - **Signed-in Users**: Can interact with the chatbot seamlessly.
  - **Unauthenticated Users**: Are redirected to the login page with a caution message if they attempt to access the chatbot.

This restriction is enforced via Firebase auth state checks and React Router‚Äôs protected routes.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features
Here‚Äôs what the platform offers:
- ‚úÖ **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and log out securely with Firebase.
- ‚úÖ **Protected Routes**: Restricts chatbot access to authenticated users only.
- ‚úÖ **AI Chatbot**: Powered by OpenRouter API, offering educational support and responses.
- ‚úÖ **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with ShadCN UI and TailwindCSS.
- ‚úÖ **Fast & Optimized**: Vite ensures quick builds and a smooth development experience.

## üìå Future Improvements
The platform has exciting potential for growth. Planned enhancements include:
- **More AI Tools**: Expand beyond the chatbot with features like AI-generated quizzes or study plans.
- **Real-Time Chat History**: Store and sync chat history using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.
- **File Upload Support**: Allow users to upload files (PDFs, CSVs, JSON, etc.) for AI analysis or processing.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Add localization for broader accessibility.
- **User Profiles**: Enable personalization with saved preferences and learning progress.
